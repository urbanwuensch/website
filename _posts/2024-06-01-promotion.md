I'm extremely delighted to announce that I have been promoted to assistant Professor in the Section for Oceans and Arctic at the National Institute of Aquatic Resources (Technical University of Denmark).

With my new position, I will focus on enzyme biogeochemistry, sensor development, and student innovation.
